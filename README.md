Game_SunVsMoon
==============

A small video game that I developed with a partner at COSMOS (California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science) 2010 Summer Program.

I created this game over roughly 2 weeks with a partner at COSMOS 2010 in the summer between my Sophomore and Junior year in Highschool.  
We were specifically in the course "Video Games: The Design of Fun from Concept to Code" called Cluster 5.

We utilized the programming language Processing, which builds on the Java programming langauge and utilizes a graphics programming model.

The game itself was inspired by Plants vs. Zombies a tower defence game utilizing lanes.
The objective of the game is to prevent monsters from walking across the screen by deploying towers that attack and destroy the monsters.
Also, the theme for the game was twilight (not the movie) and from that we came up with the corny idea of the game Sun vs. Moon.
Because when did all video games have a story that made sense in the first place?
